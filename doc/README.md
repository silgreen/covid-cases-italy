# covid-cases-italy
hi all! i did a small project to show the increase rate of new cases of COVID-19 in my country.
It is a very basic and small project, but i think that is usefull to understand how to collect
and visualize data, for a beginner. 

<h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Install Python 🐍</li>
        <li>Install matplotlib 📉</li>
    </ul>

<h2>How to use</h2>
create a JSON file with the same format of this project whith data of your country, and run the script, that's it!
